The film was intended to be the first animated feature film from Italy, but was never completed; if the film was finished, it also would have been the first cel animated feature film ever, beating Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and the first animated film adaptation based on the novel of the same name, It is now considered lost: only the original script and a couple of still frames are all that survived of the film. Currently considered a lost film.",

Geppeta's fairy godmother, a blonde played by Dyanne Thorne, magically transforms the young stud Pinocchio into a living man, who is quickly brought to work in the local whorehouse as a prize stud and exhibitionist. Nothing -- not even sex -- is taken seriously in this lighthearted, semi-pornographic offering. The film was originally rated X, but was later re-edited and given an R by the MPAA in 1977",
