In desperation, they turn to their best option to resolve this dilemma: they call for a sorcerer from home. The sorcerer hops on a jet to Paris to cast spells on the entrenched bureaucrat, and while en route he strikes up a conversation with a fellow passenger, mentioning his job pays quite well. The interested passenger could stand to make a few extra francs, so he decides to take the sorcerer's place. Once he arrives, this imposter has to act like he knows what he is doing, and at the same time, he had better solve the eviction problem.",

The band went through multiple line-ups with six different lead guitarists. While working on Rumours, the two couples at the heart of the band separated, yet this heartache inspired the perfect pop record.",

One of the bestselling albums of all time, RUMOURS' impeccable songwriting, lush vocal harmonies, and polished production stand as testament to the band's cohesive powers--a fact made even more remarkable by the romantic tensions roiling amongst its members at the time (Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks were ending their long-term romantic relationship; Christine and John McVie were getting a divorce). This episode of the CLASSIC ALBUMS series recounts the making of Fleetwood Mac's career-making opus through interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, and live performances of timeless gems such as \"Don't Stop,\" \"Dreams,\"\"Go Your Own Way,\" \"You Make Loving Fun,\" \"The Chain,\" and more.",
