The Sultan orders the army leader, along with two others, to proceed to Byzantine for espionage purposes. There, they contact a couple sympathetic to the Turkish cause and, with their home as the base, gather information about the city's defenses. The Byzantines capture the couple and two of the Turks, leaving only the army leader to escape with the vital information. The Turks use it to make an easy conquest, ending the Roman empire, and creating the Ottoman empire.",

            "overview": "Portugal's Fernando Pessoa and Greece's Constantine Cavafy were two of the greatest poets of the 20th century, and the literary giants finally met in 1929 aboard a transatlantic ocean liner carrying immigrants to the U.S. This genre-bending documentary from Greek filmmaker Stelios Charalambopoulos blends truth with fiction in imagining what that meeting must have been like, offering an innovative mix of archival footage and fictional re-enactments of the poets interacting with one of the ship's immigrant passengers.",
