She was accused of spying during the war, imprisoned, tortured and banned on radio and in theatres in her home country. After her release, she worked hard to save numerous Jewish families, while the disappearance of the man she was linked to, first arrested by the Nazis and then by the Soviets, threw her into despair. Heartbroken, marginalized and banished in the new communist regime, she went into exile in 1951, spending fifteen years in Sao Paulo, Brazil, never to act in a film or on stage again. Then he lived in New York until his death (1990).",
