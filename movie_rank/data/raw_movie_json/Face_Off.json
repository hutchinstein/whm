We had the Von Erichs/Freebirds feud in the 80\u2019s.  Hogan and Piper battled all over the country during the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s but one of the biggest feuds ever during the 90\u2019s was with two of the most extreme athletes of all time from the land of barbed wire, Tommy Dreamer and Raven.  This was by far one of wrestling biggest and longest running feuds of all time.  These men made history for over a decade battling each other on many different continents. Now for the first time RF VIDEO was able to get these two to Face Off with each other and talk about their historic program.  What made it work and stand out and how did they get it to last so long.  All of these questions get answered during Face Off Volume 9 The Extreme Rivalry!!!!",

            "overview": "Over the years RF VIDEO has done hundreds of shoot style interviews with everyone in the business.  Well on 9-11-10 we raised the bar as we conducted the most emotional and what will go down as the most controversial interview of all time in the history  of the business.  Kevin Nash and Sean Waltman gave RF VIDEO the greatest interview of all time and that is a shoot!  In the past we have hyped up our interviews but this interview was unlike anything we have ever shot before.  I really don\u2019t know where to even begin at but the mood for this interview was intense.",
