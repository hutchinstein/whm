However, the readers of the day took Dracula to their hearts and delighted in the horror of the novel. And of course as the Hollywood movie industry developed, \"Dracula\" proved a perfect candidate for the silver screen. \"Dracula\" has become a classic icon of the horror industry, complete with swirling black cape and dripping fangs - thrilling and terrifying readers and moviegoers for more than a century, and all indications are that Dracula will continue to do so for all eternity",
