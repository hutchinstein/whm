They settle into the hunter's cabin and each go to their respective beds (with the hunter promising more hunting bright and early the next morning much to the hound's disgust). At any rate, the dog settles into bed but is kept awake all night by all manner of distractions. First, he deals with a noisy cricket which he settles and then is disturbed by the moonlight outside reflecting off a clock's pendulum. After that, the rug catches fire and the heroic dog bravely saves the house from being burned to a crisp by dousing it with water. But now his bed is all wet so he settles in with his master... who snores to the point of annoyance. Finally, morning comes and the hunter is raring to go but the insomniac dog tells the old boy off and goes to live with the other animals!",

Now he is sending Amir to his colleague Ralph in exchange for an unpaid debt from a card game. He thinks that this is a good opportunity to get rid of the illegal worker. Ralph is a fifty-year-old baby who keeps forgetting his appointments, his bank balance, and everything else that he should remember to run his life smoothly. His business is a complete disaster. A year later, Ralph's business has picked up, but Joe's is going down the drain. Thanks to whom? It is easy to answer this question if one follows Amir during his daily chores in the shop. But neither Jo nor Ralph's bother to take the time off to notice the hard work of this poor employee.",
