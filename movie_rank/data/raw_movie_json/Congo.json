Congo has copious deposits of raw materials that are in high demand internationally but remains one of the poorest countries in the world.  For our translator, Bernard Kalume Buleri, his country\u2019s history of turmoil is very personal; like most Congolese people, he and his family fell victim to the unending mineral based power struggle. Born in the year of his country\u2019s independence, he has lived through war and seen his homeland torn apart by violent looting and greed. His story is a damning testament, illustrating how nature\u2019s bounty, instead of being a blessing, becomes a deadly curse.",
