Overseas, their drones have been used by the military for years, but have been forbidden for law enforcement in America.  Now OmniCorp wants to bring their controversial technology to the home front, and they see a golden opportunity to do it.  When Alex Murphy \u2013 a loving husband, father and good cop doing his best to stem the tide of crime and corruption in Detroit \u2013 is critically injured, OmniCorp sees their chance to build a part-man, part-robot police officer.  OmniCorp envisions a RoboCop in every city and even more billions for their shareholders, but they never counted on one thing: there is still a man inside the machine.",

Desperate for money, he takes his teammate Kevin\u2019s offer to deliver some cocaine. It is a set-up to take the business away from drug lord, Henry. Jack ends up in prison with Axel who was caught in the same deal.  Corrupt fight promoter, Parker, agrees to set up a fight between now blood rivals Kevin and Jack, and bets heavily on Jack. In order to ensure his success, he pumps Jack full of the experimental drug which brings out Jack\u2019s ultimate fighting power while making Kevin appear as a fearsome robot to Jack. Crazed by the drug, Jack does win the fight, and is finally able to give up the ring and seek a peaceful life.",
