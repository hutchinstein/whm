He\u2019s assigned to a death scene investigation by YAN where the deceased, YUNG\u2019s body had laid undiscovered for eight years, and only recently discovered by maintenance workers during the renovation of an old block of flat.

A temporary loss of data seems to be caused by a software glitch, nothing to worry about. Within a few days, Ana is entangled in a web of bureaucracy of Kafkaesque proportions: not being in the computer means no social security, no permanent address and no baby. She is brutally forced to leave a newborn girl alone at the hospital without any right to visit her until everything is sorted out. All of a sudden Ana is a foreigner, even though she has lived in Slovenia all of her life. Legally, she doesn\u2019t exist. So, her child is an orphan. And orphans are put up for adoption.",
