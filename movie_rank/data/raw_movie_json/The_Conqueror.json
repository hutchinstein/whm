At first things go badly for the Romans, complicated by the fact that Vercingetorix has captured and tortured a centurion named Claudius Valerius who's in love with Caesar's ward, Publia, who has also fallen into the hands of Vercingetorix. Eventually a great battle pitting Caesar against the rebellious Gaul decides the fate of all concerned.",

A relocated Hercules (KIRK MORRIS of The Witch's Curse) arrives on the scene and sets off to find a kidnapped Nomad princess. He follows her abductors past the Mountain of the Dead, through the City of the Phantoms, to a mysterious castle which turn out to be Atlantis. As if all this wasn't strange enough, Hercules will encounter gold-painted, blue body stocking-wearing, reanimated dead guys; female guards (who are killed if they taste the love of a man); a dying evil queen and her Ming the Merciless wanna-be sorcerer-scientist; and a torturous climax.",
